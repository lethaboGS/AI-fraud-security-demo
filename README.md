# AI Fraud Security Framework

**From Vulnerability to Solution: Complete AI Security for Financial Systems**

##  What This Demonstrates

I don't just find problems - I build solutions.

### Attacks Included:
- `attacks/data_poisoning.py` - How training data can be corrupted
- `attacks/model_evasion.py` - How fraud can bypass detection

### Defenses Implemented:
- `defenses/data_validation.py` - Detect and prevent data poisoning
- `defenses/model_monitoring.py` - Real-time model protection

##  Quick Start

```bash
# Run data poisoning demo
python attacks/data_poisoning.py

# Run data validation demo  
python defenses/data_validation.py

# Test model monitoring
python defenses/model_monitoring.py


Business Impact

A successful attack could cost:

    Small fintech: R2M+ monthly in undetected fraud

    Enterprise bank: R10M+ in losses and regulatory fines
